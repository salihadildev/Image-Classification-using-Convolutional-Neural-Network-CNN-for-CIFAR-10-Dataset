# Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-for-CIFAR-10-Dataset
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, and more.
